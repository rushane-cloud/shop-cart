Shopping Cart System
Overview
This Python-based shopping cart system is simple but functional. The system allows customers to browse the store catalog, add items to their shopping cart, remove unwanted products, review the contents of their cart, and complete the checkout process. The system manages inventory, applies discounts, calculates taxes, and prints receipts.
